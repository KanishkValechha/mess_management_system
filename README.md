# Mess Management System

This is a basic version of a mess management system that is made with PHP. It will run locally on your browser though you will need some knowledge of how to launch it.

I have given below some steps through which you can launch it. Follow these steps to run this in your browser:

1. Install xampp.
2. Launch xampp control panel.
3. Start Apache and MySQL.
4. Copy all the code and paste it in the xampp/htdocs/ where you have installed xampp.
5. Then type localhost/login.php on your browser.
6. Voila! It will start running. If you have any issue, you can refer to this video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcoIVp1eNgM&t=3s .
7. IMPORTANT: The most important step at last is to add database in MySQL. I have added a db called user_data.sql. Refer the below link to see how to add it to phpmyadmin. link: https://youtu.be/2ynKAAt1G4Y?si=EYVXGZ4NaHzT_QJR

Thank you!
